<hr>
I am a full-stack developer and the content of this Github page is an expression of my personal and professional journey dedicated to honing and sharing my craft.The goal of my projects is to tackle a problem from the ground up, taking into consideration planning, designing, and testing to solve a particular problem or just to explore a creative idea.

It is a very exciting time to be a developer and a technology enthusiast. I am currently immersed in the world of AI image generation and exploring the latest tools and developments it has to offer. In fact, I was able to generate my current professional LinkedIn profile picture from a stable diffusion model that I trained with images of myself. These tools are becoming better every day and more accessible and I would strongly recommend anyone interested to start exploring this emerging avenue of AI.
